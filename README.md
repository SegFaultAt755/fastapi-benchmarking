# 🚀 FastAPI Benchmarking

This repository contains a baseline implementation of a high-throughput microservice built with Python and FastAPI.

The primary goal of this project is to establish baseline performance metrics for routing and I/O-bound operations in Python.

### Requirements

- **Python** 3.13+
- **Docker** & Docker Compose
- **wrk** (for load testing)

## 🗺️ API Endpoints

This service exposes two distinct endpoints designed to test different operational scenarios:

### 1. The CPU/Routing Benchmark

- **Endpoint:** `GET /greeting`
- **Purpose:** Tests pure framework overhead, routing speed, and serialization.
- **Response:** Returns a simple "Hello, World!" string.

### 2. The I/O Benchmark

- **Endpoint:** `GET /request`
- **Purpose:** Simulates a real-world, I/O-bound workload.
- **Behavior:** Fetches a structured data record from a database.
- **Testing Variants:** Designed to be load-tested to measure how FastAPI's async event loop handles database latency.

## 🛠️ Setup & Development

To run this project locally and prepare it for load testing:

**1. Clone and navigate to the project:**

Bash

```
git clone https://github.com/SegFaultAt755/fastapi-benchmarking.git
cd fastapi-benchmarking
```

**2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

Bash

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Run the application:**

Bash

```
docker compose up --build
```

> **Note:** For production-grade benchmarking, it is highly recommended to run Uvicorn with multiple workers inside the `Dockerfile`.

## ⚙️ Load Testing Tool (wrk) Setup

To run the benchmarks, you will need to install `wrk`. Use the command appropriate for your operating system:

**MacOS (Homebrew):**

Bash

```
brew install wrk
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**

Bash

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wrk
```

**Arch Linux:**

Bash

```
yay -S wrk
```

_(The AUR doesn't have `wrk` natively via `pacman`, so `yay` is used to install it)._

**Windows:** `wrk` is not natively supported on Windows. You must install it inside WSL or download `winrk.exe` from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winrk/).

## 📊 Benchmarking Methodology

To ensure a fair and rigorous test, we use the standard load testing tool `wrk` to simulate real-world traffic patterns and hit our target endpoints. Our approach focuses on establishing a controlled environment where variables are isolated, allowing us to accurately identify bottlenecks and measure the system's scalability limits.

### Hardware Specifications

|**Component**|**Specification**|
|---|---|
|**OS**|Arch Linux x86_64|
|**CPU**|AMD Ryzen 5 5600 (12) @ 4.470GHz|
|**RAM**|15,862 MiB DDR4|
|**Storage**|512GB NVMe SSD|

### Test Environment & Setup

To ensure consistency, all tests were performed in a clean, isolated containerized environment.

- **Command:** `docker compose up --build`
- **Target Endpoints:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/greeting` & `http://127.0.0.1:8000/request`
- **Test Command:** `wrk -t5 -c100 -d20s http://127.0.0.1:8000/[endpoint]`
- **Configuration:** 5 threads, 100 connections, 20-second duration.

### Metrics Tracked

- **Thread Stats:** Active concurrent threads and resource consumption.
- **Average Latency:** Mean time to process a request and return a response.
- **Throughput:** Total volume of requests handled per second.
- **Transfer/Sec:** Network bandwidth utilization (MB/s).

## 📈 Performance Summary

### `/greeting` Benchmark

**Raw `wrk` Output:**

```
Running 20s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8000/greeting
  5 threads and 100 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency    72.03ms  184.18ms   1.10s    91.11%
    Req/Sec     1.33k   250.90     2.00k    89.90%
  118269 requests in 20.02s, 17.03MB read
Requests/sec:   5907.19
Transfer/sec:      0.85MB
```

**Results:**

| **Key Metric**           | **Result**     |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Average Latency**      | 72.03 ms       |
| **Total Requests**       | 118,269        |
| **Throughput (Req/Sec)** | 5,907.19 req/s |
| **Transfer Rate**        | 0.85 MB/s      |

### `/request` Benchmark

**Raw `wrk` Output:**

Plaintext

```
Running 20s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8000/request
  5 threads and 100 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency    49.51ms   54.58ms 618.71ms   87.49%
    Req/Sec   545.72    105.83   838.00     72.03%
  54050 requests in 20.02s, 60.72MB read
Requests/sec:   2700.15
Transfer/sec:      3.03MB
```

**Results:**

|**Key Metric**|**Result**|
|---|---|
|**Average Latency**|49.51 ms|
|**Total Requests**|54,050|
|**Throughput (Req/Sec)**|2,700.15 req/s|
|**Transfer Rate**|3.03 MB/s|

> ⚠️ **Note:** Pay close attention to **Throughput**. Even though the average latency for `/request` is lower, it processed significantly fewer total requests than the `/greeting` endpoint.
